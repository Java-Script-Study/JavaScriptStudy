    <p>How many special people change
        How many lives are living strange
        Where were you when we were getting high?
        Slowly walking down the hall
        Faster than a cannon ball
        Where were you while we were getting high?
        Some day you will find me
        Caught beneath the landslide
        In a champagne supernova in the sky
        Some day you will find me
        Caught beneath the landslide
        In a champagne supernova
        A champagne supernova in the sky
        Wake up the dawn and ask her why
        A dreamer dreams she never dies
        Wipe that tear away now from your eye
        Slowly walking down the hall
        Faster than a cannon ball
        Where were you when we were getting high?
        Some day you will find me
        Caught beneath the landslide
        In a champagne supernova in the sky
        Some day you will find me
        Caught beneath the landslide
        In a champagne supernova
        A champagne supernova in the sky
        Cos people believe that they're
        Gonna get away for the summer
        But you and I, we live and die
        The world's still spinning round
        We don't know why
        Why, why, why, why
        How many special people change
        How many lives are living strange
        Where were you when we were getting high?
        Slowly walking down the hall

        We were getting high
        We were getting high
        We were getting high
        We were getting high</p>
